# Data Cleaning Workflow

A data cleaning, preprocessing and visualization workflow for my Programming for Data Analytics module.

## Project Overview

This project contains a full workflow for cleaning, preprocessing, and visualizing data.
It is meant to help demonstrate good practices in data cleaning and prepare data for analysis or further processing.
The primary goal is to turn raw data into clean, structured and usable datasets, while documenting each step clearly,
and to produce visualizations that help understand the cleaned data.

## Technologies and Tools

- Python
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- numpy (for numerical operations)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)

## Project Structure

PDAS_CA1.ipynb
    Main notebook showing the data cleaning, preprocessing and visualization workflow

PDAS CA1.pptx
    Presentation or summary of the workflow

## Getting Started / How to Use

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/pufferfish3e/data-cleaning-workflow.git

2. Install dependencies (if needed)
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib catppucin

   or create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate (Mac/Linux)
   venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib catppucin

3. Open the main notebook: PDAS_CA1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.

4. Run through the notebook to see how raw data is cleaned, prepared, and visualized.

## What This Project Does

- Demonstrates a clean, reproducible data-cleaning pipeline
- Shows example data preprocessing steps (handling missing values, data transformation, etc.)
- Generates visualizations to illustrate cleaned data distributions and insights
- Serves as a template for future data-cleaning and data-analysis projects

## Why This Matters / Use Cases

- Useful for learning or teaching data cleaning workflows
- Helps standardize cleaning steps to minimize errors and increase reproducibility
- Good reference for other data-analysis or data-science tasks
- Can be adapted or extended to similar datasets or more complex workflows

## Potential Future Enhancements

- Add a sample raw dataset for end-to-end demonstration
- Add automated data validation and logging steps
- Create a modular pipeline (Python scripts instead of notebook) for reuse
- Expand documentation: include before/after data snapshots, expected schema, data dictionary
- Add more advanced visualizations (histograms, correlation matrices, missing-data heatmaps, etc.)
